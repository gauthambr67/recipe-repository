## Next Steps

1. Currently the create, read and delete function for recipes works. The reviews part is supposed to have the update functionality, but it isn't working. Will have to fix this.
2. Have full CRUD functionality for both Recipes and Reviews.
3. Have a more polished interface.

## Additional features

Consume an ingredients API and work on an inventory management to predict requirement of groceries for recipes chosen.
